                <div id="skid-steer">

                    <p>I had just got back from the UK where I was working as a forklift operator and I knew that I liked working and operating with machines
                        and I did a course in heavy-weight construction machines. I got a job at this local company and now I was operating skid steers and excavators.

                <div id="thinking">

                    <p>I was happy with the job. The collegues ware good, the salary was good , i was at good place. But than i started to think - where is the highest rank in this area? What should i aim for? I figured out that there isnt much room for a self devolopment. i tough that in maybe 3 years i can be supervisor on the job site or something like that but i want to learn new thing every day. That's why i started thinking again what will be the area in which i will never bored?</p>
